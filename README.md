## ## How to Run the Analysis

1.  [cite_start]**Open Notebook:** Open `notebook_1.ipynb` in Google Colab. [cite: 10]
2.  **Upload Data:** Upload the two initial datasets (`historical_data.csv` and `fear_greed_index.csv`) to the Colab environment.
3.  **Execute Code:** Run all the cells in the notebook from top to bottom.
4.  **Check Outputs:** The script will automatically generate the processed CSV in the `csv_files/` directory and all chart images in the `outputs/` directory.
